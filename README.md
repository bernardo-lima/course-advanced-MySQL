# Course: Advanced MySQL for Analytics &amp; Business Intelligence

This repository contains the code I used to solve the assigments of the course [SQL - Advanced MySQL for Analytics & Business Intelligence](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-sql-mysql-for-analytics-business-intelligence/) by Maven Analytics at Udemy. 
All code is my own, and, sometimes, my solution is different than the one from the course. In some instances, I present my and the courseâ€™s solution to a specific problem and comment on the differences. I also tried to use different approaches to solve similar problems (i.e. subqueries, temporary tables and common table expressions). 

The code for each section of the course is located in a separate file.
